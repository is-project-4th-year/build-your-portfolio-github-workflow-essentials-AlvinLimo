## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different sections of the site.
- **Merging**: Helps in adding changes to the main branch from other branches
- **Resolving Conflicts**: This is used when you update the same line that is in the main branch and another branch, it solves the issue on which branch will be used in the update
- **Pulling**: For downloading and merge the remote changes
- **Checkout**: For switching between branches

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features
